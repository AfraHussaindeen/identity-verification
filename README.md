Identity verification(IDV), is a crucial component of managing user access and verifying identities in systems and platforms. It enables organizations to confirm the identity of users through various authentication methods, such as by checking legal documents, like passports, national identification cards, and driver's licenses.
IDV is a critical aspect of security and risk management, as it helps to prevent identity fraud and ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive systems and data. By implementing IDV, organizations can protect themselves from potential threats and enhance the overall security of their systems.
